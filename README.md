# Full State Linear Reconstruction of SPMSG systems
This repository contains simulations and code for an improved linear controller based on full state reconstruction, including conmparisons with a PI-based controller and an ESO-ITSMVC controller.
The implementation is available in MATLAB (R2020b for simulink and R2019b for the code).
## Features
Simulations: Users can adjust various parameters to simulate different operation conditions.  
Code: Code for this experiment validation is written in MATLAB and translatable to C through MATLAB code generation.
## Contact
For any queries or further discussion regarding the project, please open an issue in this repository or direct connect kaipeng@hust.edu.cn.
